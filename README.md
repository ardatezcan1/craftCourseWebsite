**Handicrafts Course Management System**

This project is developed to facilitate the management of various handicrafts courses offered by a company. The main goal is to create a system that allows staff to efficiently plan, schedule, and manage courses, teachers, and students.

**Key Features**

**Course Planning**

The system assists staff in organizing course programs by providing the following functionalities:

**Handicraft Selection:** Staff can determine which handicrafts will be included in a course. The system helps by listing eligible handicrafts based on the course type and schedule (weekday or weekend).
**Teacher Assignment:** Once the handicrafts and schedule are set, the system assists in selecting an available teacher for each session, ensuring the chosen teachers are available at the selected times.
**Cost Calculation:** After planning the course content and assigning teachers, the system calculates the total cost of the course.
**Course Enrollment and Sales**
The system facilitates the enrollment and payment process with these features:

**Course Listing:** Based on the student's preferences for handicrafts, schedule (weekday or weekend), and budget, the system lists suitable courses.
**Registration and Payment:** Students can choose a course and complete the payment (cash or credit card).
**Record Keeping:** The system records the details of each sale, including student information, selected course, payment amount, and date.
